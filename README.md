<p>This is my first attempt at utalizing Google Firebase and trying to understand and use their backend authentication.</p>
<p>It is simply a sign in page with an email address and a password</p>
<p>By understanding and learning about Firebase, opens many oportunities for web app development as Firebase does alot of backend stuff for developers, allowing the developer to focus more on front end.</p>
